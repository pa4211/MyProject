            "Fresh Garden Peas",
            "Ghee",
            "Cashew Nuts",

            "Crumbled Cottage Cheese (Paneer)",
            "Sugar",
            "Green Cardamom (powdered)",
            "Optional: Milk, Khoya, or Mawa"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Snip the end of the fresh Garden Peas, string them, and open them up. Push out all the peas and collect them in a bowl.",
            "Transfer the Garden Peas into a jar and crush them into a fine paste.",
            "Turn on the flame, add a little bit of Ghee to a pan, and saute Cashew Nuts until golden brown.",
            "Add roughly cut Almonds and saute them on medium flame. Once done, move them aside.",
            "In the same Kadhai, add the remaining Ghee. Immediately, add the Green Pea Pulp.",
            "Stir the Green Pea Pulp well and ensure it cooks perfectly. As it cooks, it will transition from a pasty texture to a slightly grittier one.",
            "Once the Green Peas are cooked and the Ghee begins to release from the sides, add Crumbled Cottage Cheese (Paneer).",
            "Saute the Cottage Cheese with the Green Peas on medium flame. You can break the grits if desired, which is a personal choice.",
            "If you prefer, you can make the recipe usual by adding Milk, Khoya, or Mawa, but the chef recommends using Cottage Cheese for a unique spongy and bouncy texture.",
            "Add Sugar to the mixture. As the Sugar melts, the mixture will begin to liquefy. Keep mixing to ensure the Sugar does not caramelize, which could change the Halwa\u2019s color.",
            "Add powdered Green Cardamom and half of the Dry Fruits.",
            "Give the mixture a final mix. The Matar Ka Halwa or Green Peas Halwa is now ready.",
            "Note: If fresh Green Peas are not available, frozen Peas can be used as a substitute."
