        "instructions": [
            "Take the Moong Dal (Green Gram), wash it nicely a couple of times, and soak it overnight.",
            "Begin cooking by heating Desi Ghee in a pan.",
            "Once the Ghee begins to melt, add in Cumin Seeds.",
            "Add Paste of Garlic and Chillies, followed by Tomato Puree, and Red Chilli Powder.",
            "Mix well to ensure the raw flavor of the Tomato Puree goes away. The idea is to intensify the color of the Tomatoes.",
            "Add the soaked Moong Dal along with the soaking water at room temperature.",
            "Mix well and scrape in all the sides of the pan to incorporate the goodness of the Tomato and Garlic into the Dal.",
            "Add Salt and give it a quick mix.",
            "Cover the pan and cook the Dal under pressure for 20 minutes or for 3 whistles on high flame. Wait for the pressure to settle.",
            "Once the pressure settles, remove the whistle and check the Dal. It should be nice and mushy.",
            "Whisk the cooked Dal to achieve a smooth consistency.",
            "Add Butter, a generous pinch of Garam Masala, and Cream to the Dal.",
            "Turn the flame on for a couple more minutes and whisk the Dal again to ensure a velvety, Makhan-like texture.",
            "The Moong Dal Makhani is now ready to be served. It pairs well with Roti, Naan, Paratha, Kulcha, or Rice."
