            "Snip the ends off the Green Zucchini and cut it into batons. Set aside.",
            "Peel and cut the Carrots into batons. Set aside.",
            "Cut the Green Capsicum into strips. Set aside.",
            "Cut the Red Bell Peppers into strips. Set aside.",
            "Push the center out of the Red Onions and separate into rings. Set aside.",
            "Trim the Broccoli into long florets, almost like Broccolini. Set aside.",
            "To make the tempura batter, ensure the water being used is ice-cold. This is crucial as tempura making is all about temperature play: the oil must be hot, and the batter must be chilled. The clash of temperatures is what creates the magic.",
            "In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.",
            "Add ice-cold water to the dry mixture and mix to form the tempura batter. Ensure the batter is chilled before proceeding.",
            "Heat oil in a pan or wok until it reaches the right temperature for deep frying.",
            "Dip the prepared vegetables one by one into the chilled tempura batter, ensuring they are well coated.",
            "Drop the battered vegetables carefully into the hot oil. Be slightly quicker at this stage.",
            "If you notice fritters dropping in oil unevenly, that's perfect, as it adds to the crunch.",
            "Fry the vegetables until they are cooked but still sparkling white. Do not let them gain any coloration; this is a sign of good-quality tempura.",
            "Remove the fried vegetables from the oil and drain on a paper towel.",
            "Repeat the process for the remaining vegetables.",
            "Serve the Vegetable Tempura with a Thai Chili dip, Schezwan sauce, or any dip of your choice that is not bland\u2014something spicy, tangy, or zesty.",
            "Enjoy your Vegetable Tempura with patience, time, and lots of love for this Japanese delicacy."
