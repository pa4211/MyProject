        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut broccoli into nice long strips, almost like broccolini, and dunk these in water.",
            "Heat a grill pan and brush it with a little bit of oil.",
            "Pick the broccoli pieces, dab them on a towel to ensure the water is taken care of, and place them carefully on the grill pan.",
            "Grill the broccoli in 2-3 batches depending on the quantity. The grill method helps retain the bite and color of the broccoli.",
            "Once grilled to your choice, transfer the broccoli to a platter. This platter will also serve as the serving dish to reduce extra work.",
            "Grill more broccoli florets if needed.",
            "To prepare the sauce, combine crushed garlic, light soy sauce, a teaspoon of cornstarch, tomato ketchup (for glaze and shine), sugar (depending on desired sweetness), chilli flakes (for spice), a touch of salt (remembering soy sauce already has salt), a little oil, freshly cracked black pepper, and cold water in a bowl.",
            "Mix the sauce ingredients thoroughly, ensuring the mixture is lump-free by breaking the lumps of the cornstarch. Create a little whirlwind in the bowl.",
            "Turn on the flame in another pan and add the sauce mixture before the pan heats up.",
            "Keep mixing the sauce. As it heats up, it will become glossier, denser, and thicker.",
            "Once the sauce is ready, turn off the flame.",
            "Serve the grilled broccoli with the prepared sauce. Enjoy Chilli Garlic Broccoli with your family and friends!"
